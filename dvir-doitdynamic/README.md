Do it dynamic
-------------
- Convert your terraform code from "Do it easy" to be dynamic: Use variables everywhere that is appropriate.
- Manage your Terraform state remotely, in an S3 bucket.


To hand in
----------
All your terraform files, inside a folder named `<your-name>-doitdynamic`, which is zipped as `<your-name>-doitdynamic.zip`.
Meaning, when unzipping your file, the result is a directory named `<your-name>-doitdynamic` which contains all the relevant files.
